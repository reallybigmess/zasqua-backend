# Changelog

All notable changes to the Zasqua backend will be documented in this file. Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-14

First release. Django cataloging backend with CollectiveAccess migration, REST API, and static data export.

### Added

- Django 5.1 backend with 6-model schema: Repository, Description (MPTT), Entity, Place, DescriptionEntity, DescriptionPlace
- CollectiveAccess migration pipeline — 104,465 descriptions, 90,786 entities, 977 places imported with EAV attributes and structured date parsing
- Entity schema: honorific, primary_function, surname, given_name fields; Neogranadina IDs (ne-xxxxx) for all entities
- REST API (Django REST Framework) with paginated endpoints for descriptions, entities, places, and tree navigation
- N+1 query elimination in list endpoints using MPTT lft/rght values and queryset annotations
- `export_frontend_data` management command — exports descriptions, repositories, and tree children as static JSON for the frontend build
- `import_ocr_text` management command — imports and compresses OCR text from CollectiveAccess (14,272 descriptions)
- `short_name` field on Repository model for abbreviated display in search filters
- Meilisearch integration (retained as fallback, not required for the public site)

### Fixed

- Language field mapped from raw CollectiveAccess list-item IDs (192, 173, 195) to display names during export
- Children level detection for AHRB: legajo containers correctly identified at fonds level, CAB series return item-level children
